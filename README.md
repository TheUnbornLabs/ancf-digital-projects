# ANCF Digital Projects

**100 Antinatalism & Childfree Tools, Games, Guides, and Reflection Projects**

An open, ad-free, tracking-free static website collecting 100 small, self-contained projects that explore antinatalism and childfree life as ethical, philosophical, personal, and social positions.

**Live site:** https://theunbornlabs.github.io/ancf-digital-projects/

Every one of the 100 projects is a real interactive mini-tool, guide, quiz, calculator, generator, or game — not a static paragraph page. All run client-side with no backend and no tracking.

## Mission

To present antinatalism and childfree life respectfully and rationally — as rights-based, educational, and reflective positions. Every project supports reproductive autonomy and treats children, parents, women, men, families, religions, castes, ethnic groups, people in poverty, disabled people, and LGBTQ+ people with dignity. There is no hate speech, no harassment, and no encouragement of self-harm.

## Features

- Static site: only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON (and Markdown docs). No backend, no login, no ads, no tracking.
- Searchable, filterable gallery of all 100 projects on the homepage.
- Ten categories: Philosophy, Childfree Life, Ethics, Society, Comics, Games, Calculators, Learning Tools, Writing Tools, Community Tools.
- Dark-mode toggle (remembers your choice on your device).
- Mobile-first, responsive layout that works on Android Chrome and desktop.
- Each project has a working interactive feature (quizzes, calculators with visible formulas, generators with copy-to-clipboard, lightweight games, collapsible guides, checklists, and more).
- All user input stays in the browser (localStorage) — nothing is uploaded.

## 100 Biases of Natalism

A companion collection at `/biases/`: one hundred pages, one per bias, covering the
mechanisms — cognitive, biological, cultural, religious, economic, rhetorical,
philosophical, and gendered — that make having children feel like the default rather
than a decision. Each page carries an expandable twelve-chapter map of the argument
(including the chapter that states the strongest case *against* the volume's own
thesis), key-term flashcards, a ten-question comprehension check with the reasoning
shown, private reflection prompts, and the sources the volume relies on.

The stance is the same as the rest of the site: the target is the bias, never the
people. Nothing in the collection argues that having children is a mistake, or that
the childfree chose more wisely.

## Run locally

Because it is a pure static site, you can open `index.html` directly, but a tiny local server avoids
any browser file-path quirks:

```bash
# Python 3
cd ancf-digital-projects
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Publish with GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named `ancf-digital-projects` on GitHub.
2. Push this folder's contents to the `main` branch (see commands below).
3. In the repository: **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Set **Branch** to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`, then **Save**.
6. Wait a minute; your site appears at:
   `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/ancf-digital-projects/`

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "ANCF Digital Projects: 100 projects, homepage, and docs"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ancf-digital-projects.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Add a new project

1. Create a folder `projects/NNN-your-slug/` with `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`.
2. Reuse the shared styles by linking `../../style.css` and `../../script.js` in your `index.html`.
3. Add an entry to `data/projects.json` and to the `window.__PROJECTS__` array embedded in `index.html`
   so the homepage gallery, search, and filters include it.
4. Wire the Previous/Next links to the neighbouring project folders.
